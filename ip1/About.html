<h5>What Is Your Best? “Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later.” Og Mandino</h5>
<p>Here are many books that tell us how to manage better, be more productive, “think outside the box,” make more money, and get more clients or associates—even how to “crush” the competition. The very title Being Better Than Your Best suggests competition
    with yourself; in this case, in order for you to win, no one has to lose. When you have something great to offer people, there’s always room for you in the marketplace so, competing with yourself is truly the key to being your very best. If you’re
    not happy or not finding joy in your work, then everything you accomplish will simply leave you feeling empty. That’s why some people who basically have all the things they want—cars, money, stock options, retirement plans, pensions, vacations, and
    so forth—one day look in the mirror and say, “There’s something missing.” It’s true that aspiring for the things that money can buy can be a driving force in our productive efforts. After all, money certainly makes things easier. It’s great to not
    have to worry about paying the bills or buying something for your family or yourself. But a feeling of challenge and stimulation while earning that money is a key ingredient to a happy, fulfilled life.</p>
